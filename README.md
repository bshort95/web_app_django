Web app with django

i have allways enjoyed telling jokes and using puns, but i always run out of material so i decieded to make a blog-like web application where you can sign up and then post your favorite puns and jokes. 

i used vscode as my ide but i created the website using django which is a python librarys spicificly used to create web apps. to use django without messing with other servers i first had to create a virtual enviroment. this was a little intiminating at first becuase i have never created a virtual enviroment up to this point. i use a pc so some of the commands will be different for those on an apple or linux machine

here is a tutorial if you want to set up your own enviorment


## creation proccess
django is great in many respects. for example it automaticly comes with
and admin page and there are many portions of the library you can tranfer over that become useful and save time coding. 

the problems with django are that there are so many libraries there is definitly a learning curve when it comes to figuring out which libraries to use, or how all of the programs fit together. 

the library uses other programming languages as well so to use it effeciently you will also need to understand html, css, and .sql if you add a database, along with knowing the sytax of python. 

## web app features

on the homepage i feature the newest joke, that way if people contibute activly, it can serve as a joke-a-day

the next page i have is a catalog that contains all the jokes that have been posted, so anyone can read them like a list

next i have a sign in page, 
if you do not have an account you can press the link under the text
and you get sent to the register page

![screen example](https://github.com/bshort95/web_app_django/blob/master/Capture3.JPG?raw=true)

you need to be signed in to add a post or
edit/delete your own posts

you can press the last button to make you own post and becuase it is the newest it will automaticly be sent to the homepage

![screen example](\https://github.com/bshort95/web_app_django/blob/master/Capture4.JPG?raw=true)

when you press a post itself you will be sent to a detail
view where if you are the posts writer you will be allowed to 
edit or delete it

![screen example](https://github.com/bshort95/web_app_django/blob/master/Capture5.JPG?raw=true)

lastly when you are signed in the sign in button changes to a sign out button and you can press it to be signed out.

![screen example](https://github.com/bshort95/web_app_django/blob/master/Capture6.JPG?raw=true)

if you try to add a post without being signed in it will prompt you to sign in. 



overall this was the most confusing out of all my programs to do but i learned a lot.
